So funny story, after allegedlly hosting a game site (*cough cough* asquidboi.github.io) My entire domain for GithubPages is, you guessed it, b l o c k e d

i have 3 options: 

1. Buy a domain
2. Figure out how the hell to use Jekyll
3. Make a new github account
4. The next statement is true
5. The previous statement is false
   
I would say that #4 is use google sites like a normal person but that's completely out of the question, i am banned from Google due to the extensive list of war crimes i did NOT commit
